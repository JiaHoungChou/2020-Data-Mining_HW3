## SOM Neural Network by scratch
## Quastion 1 : Write a computer program for SOM neural network and use IRIS data set to verify your program with following requirements :
### (1) Test different network topologies, like 5X5 and10X10, and find the best network structure.
### (2) Test different training rates.
### (3) Use program to draw the learning curve as shown in appendix 1.
### (4) Use Excel, Matlab or Python to draw output topology as shown in appendix 2.
### (5) Compare your result with that of Weka or Python.
### (6) Present your work on December 10, 2020 in class.
